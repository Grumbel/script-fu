    <h2><a name="preface">Preface</a></h2>

    <p>The following tutorial is written for <strong>The Gimp
	1.1.24</strong>. Some things described here will not work or will work
      differently with The Gimp 1.0.x.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is a short tutorial in Script-Fu programming. I'll try to
      give a short intro into the world of Script-Fu and explain how
      basic things works. We will create a complete script-fu
      step-by-step. The goal is to have a Script-Fu, which produces a
      metal style text. I assume, that the reader has a basic knowlege
      of Scheme, which is the programming language that is used in
      Script-Fu</p>

    <h2><a name="#first">First step on the road to a Script-Fu</a></h2>

    <p>Ok, now we take the first step:what we want to do
      in Script-Fu,  we try to do first in The Gimp as normal.
      That is important, 'cause we need to know exactly which
      operation we need, and in which order we need to call them.</p>

    <p>So let's create our test image, first of we create a new rgb
      image (<tt class="menu">File-&gt;New Image</tt>) and insert some
      text into it, say the word "Test".</p>

      <img src="images/step1.jpg">

    <p>Then we duplicate the text and apply a metal gradient to the
      top layer.</p>

      <img src="images/step2.jpg">

    <p>Then we take the second text layer and enlarge it a bit, to do
      so, we use the alpha-to-selection function and grow the
      selection by a few pixels. Then we fill the selection with the
      same gradient, but in a another orientation.</p>

      <img src="images/step3.jpg">

    <p>At last, we merge the layers and apply a standard drop
      shadow. When that is done, we auto-crop the image, to remove all
      unnecessary parts of the image.</p>

    <img src="images/step4.jpg">

    <h2><a name="repro">Reproducing the steps in the Script-Fu Console</a></h2>

    <p>Ok: the image looks now as we expected it to, so lets summarize
       what we have done:</p>

    <ol>
	<li>Create an new image</li>
	<li>Create a text layer</li>
	<li>Duplicate the text layer</li>
	<li>Enlarge the bottom text layer</li>
	<li>Fill both text layers with a gradient</li>
	<li>Merge the text layers</li>
	<li>Apply a drop shadow</li>
	<li>Merge all layers</li>
	<li>Auto-crop the image</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The task is now to reproduce these steps in the <strong>Script-Fu
      Console</strong>: where you can enter Script-Fu Commands
      and test them. Use the Console to test all new
      functions you aren't handy with; in the Console you can
      more or less debug your written scripts. It's easiest if you
      test every line of Script-Fu first in the Console and then
      parallel-write the Script-Fu, once the commands act as you
      expect them to.</p>

    <img src="images/script-fu-console.png">

    <p>To do so, we open the Script-Fu Console (<tt
      class="menu">Xtns-&gt;Script-fu-&gt;Consol</tt>). When the
      console is open, we click on the <tt class="menu">Browse...</tt> button in the bottom
      left corner; this brings us to the <strong>DB
      Browser</strong>, where you can search for
      functions which you can access from within Script-Fu. Along
      with the name of the function, you also get a description of the
      arguments it expects and a general description what the function
      does.</p>

    <img src="images/db-browser.png">

    <p>Now it's time to reproduce our first step in the image
      creation, so we need a function to create an new image. Most of
      the functions you find in the DB Browser have names similar to those
      in the menus of the Gimp. After a little search for "new" we
      find the function <tt class="code">gimp-image-new</tt>, which
      sounds like what we are searching for. We enter the following
      into the console:</p>

    <pre class="code">(gimp-image-new 256 256 RGB)</pre>

    <p>and we will get an output as follows:</p>

    <pre class="console-output">=&gt; (gimp-image-new 256 256 RGB)

(3)</pre>

    <p>The first line is simply the command that was executed, the
      second line is the return value of the function. As you can read
      in the DB Browser, this is the ID of the newly created
      image. You can simply use the ID as an argument to functions in the
      console. The return value is also the first pitfall on our
      journey to Script-Fu. It comes as a one element long list and
      <em>not</em> as a integer value! So to use the value, we have to
      get the first element of the list with <tt
      class="code">car</tt>, it will then return the image with ID 3.</p>

    <P>You might now wonder, where the image is that we have created,
      'cause you cannot see it. The answer is: we don't have a
      display for it, so the image is only inside the memory, but is
      not displayed, so we need create an display for it.  So we try
      <tt class="code">(gimp-display-new 3)</tt>, but we get an error:
    </p>

    <pre class="console-output">ERROR: Procedural database execution failed:
    (gimp_display_new 3)</pre>

    <p>So, that's just another pitfall. Not all functions in Script-Fu,
      act the same as their counterparts in the menus. Sometimes
      they are much more low-level, so you have to do some more work,
      to get the results you expect. The problem here is that our
      newly created image doesn't contain any layers. To display an
      image, we actually need at least one layer. So the next step is
      to create an layer:</p>

<pre class="console-output">=&gt; (gimp-layer-new 3 256 256 RGB-IMAGE "foobar" 100 NORMAL-MODE)

(21)</pre>

    <p>You might notice that the constants RGB-IMAGE and NORMAL-MODE
      is listed as RGB_IMAGE and NORMAL_MODE in the DB Browser (notice
      the underscore '_'). You have to replace all the underscrores
      with minus's '-' in the Script-Fu world. If your are unsure if
      your replacements are right, just enter the constant into the
      console.</p>

    <p>The next step is to add the newly created layer to the
      image, as described in the DB browser:</p>

<pre class="console-output">=&gt; (gimp-image-add-layer 3 21 -1)

()</pre>
And now we can finally display our image:

<pre class="console-output">=&gt; (gimp-display-new 3)

(4)</pre>

    <p>The displayed image looks a bit wierd, cause it is filled with
      random colors, to erase them, we will fill the layer with the
      current background color.</p>

    <pre class="console-output">=&gt; (gimp-drawable-fill 21 BG-IMAGE-FILL)

()</pre>

    <p>The function to fill a layer is called <tt
      class="code">gimp-drawable-fill</tt> and not <tt
      class="code">gimp-layer-fill</tt> as you might expect, that's
      because a layer is a drawable. So if you are searching for
      functions to manipulate layers, you should also look out for
      stuff that manipulates drawables.</p>

    <p>Now we have our image set up. To quick for you? Then lets
      summarize and write our first scheme function. First we
      encapsule all of it into a let* clause, and than add the let* clause
      into a function body:</p>

<pre class="code">(define (my-make-new-image)
 (let* ((image (car (gimp-image-new 256 256 RGB)))
        (layer (car (gimp-layer-new image 256 256
                     RGB-IMAGE "foobar" 100 NORMAL-MODE))))
       (gimp-drawable-fill layer BG-IMAGE-FILL)
       (gimp-image-add-layer image layer 0)
       (gimp-display-new image)
       image))</pre>

    <p>The last line in a scheme function is the return value, so <tt
      class="code">image</tt> is the return value in this
      function.</p>

    <p>So back to our metal-text thing, we need now to add a text
      string and play with it. A little browsing in the DB brings up
      <tt class="code">gimp-text-fontname</tt>.  To call it we type:</p>

<pre class="console-output">=&gt; (gimp-text-fontname 3 21 -1 0 "Foobar" 0 TRUE 25 PIXELS
		    "-freefont-blippo-heavy-r-normal-*-24-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")

(33)</pre>

    <p>And voila, we have our text on a newly created layer. The
      string <tt class="code">"-freefont-blippo-heavy-r-normal-*-24-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1"</tt>
      might look like black-magic to you, but we will see later an easy
      way to create it.</p>

    <p>Now we need to duplicate that layer, you might notice that there is
      no duplicate layer function in the DB, so we need to do it
      manually and write another scheme function:</p>

<pre class="code">(define (my-duplicate-layer image layer)
	(let* ((dup-layer (car (gimp-layer-copy layer 1))))
              (gimp-image-add-layer image dup-layer 0)
	      dup-layer))</pre>
and then:

<pre class="console-output">=&gt; (my-duplicate-layer 3 34)

41</pre>

    <p>The next step is to add some space for the enlarged text
      border, gimp-layer-resize is our friend:</p>

    <pre class="console-output">(gimp-layer-resize 41 200 100 5 5)</pre>

    <p>This works, but the width and height are hard coded, so we try
      again in a more flexible manner:</p>

    <pre class="code">(define (my-layer-add-border layer border)
	(let* ((width  (car (gimp-drawable-width  layer)))
	       (height (car (gimp-drawable-height layer))))
	       (gimp-layer-resize layer
				  (+ width border) (+ height border)
				  (/ border 2) (/ border 2))))</pre>

    <p>Now we need to transfer the layers alpha cannel to the
      selection and grow it some pixels:</p>

    <pre class="code">(gimp-selection-layer-alpha 41)
(gimp-selection-grow 3 5)</pre>

    <p>Before we fill the layer, we have to remove the "Keep trans"
      flag, which causes that all transparent areas stay
      transparent:</p>

    <pre class="code">(gimp-layer-set-preserve-trans 41 0)</pre>

    <p>Now we will fill the selection with a gradient:</p>

    <pre class="code">(gimp-blend 41 CUSTOM NORMAL LINEAR 100 0 REPEAT-NONE FALSE 0 0 0 0 30 50)</pre>

    <h2><a name="write">Writing down the Script-Fu</a></h2>

    <p>Huh, now we have everything for our script-fu ready, we just
      need to attach the pieces. In the following steps we will also
      remove some unnecessary action and probably add some stuff.</p>

    <p>Ok, so how to write a Script-Fu? Well, you need basically three
      things. First, a file where your script is written down, that file
      should be placed in <tt
      class="file">~/.gimp-1.1/scripts/</tt>. Second, a function, which does
      all the image manipulation, and finally you need to have a call
      to <tt class="code">script-fu-register</tt> to make your script
      visible from inside the Gimp.</p>

    <p>So lets write an empty function and register it. You should
    copy&amp;paste the following code into a file <tt
    class="file">dummy.scm</tt> and save it to <tt
    class="file">~/.gimp-1.1/scripts/</tt> as described above.</p>

    <pre class="code">(define (my-dummy-function a b)
  (print "Do nothing"))

(script-fu-register "my-dummy-function"
		    _"&lt;Toolbox&gt;/Xtns/Script-Fu/My Stuff/Dummy..."
		    "Do nothing"
		    "Joey User"
		    "Joey User"
		    "August 2000"
		    ""
		    SF-ADJUSTMENT _"Width" '(400 1 2000 1 10 0 1)
		    SF-ADJUSTMENT _"Height" '(30 1 2000 1 10 0 1))</pre>


    <p>When you then press <tt
      class="menu">Xtns-&gt;Scritp-fu-&gt;Reload</tt> your script will
      be loaded into the Gimp and should be accessable from the
      menu.</p>

    <p>Notice, that there are two kinds of Script-Fu's. The first kind
      will create a new image, thats used for logo's and accessible
      through the menu <tt
      class="menu">Xtns-&gt;Scritp-fu-&gt...</tt>, and the second kind
      will manipulate an existing image, this kind is accessible
      through the right-click pop-up menu on an image <tt
      class="menu">Scritp-fu-&gt...</tt>. To register the second kind
      of Script-Fu, you need to adjust the path to <tt
      class="code">&lt;Image&gt;/Script-Fu/...</tt> and it needs to
      take the first two arguments of type SF-IMAGE and
      SF-DRAWABLE.</p>

    <p>This brings us to the next topic, the arguments that your
      function can get, they can have the following types:</p>

    <table border="1">
      	<tr>
	  <th>Argument Type</th>
	  <th>Data Type</th>
	  <th>Description</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-IMAGE</tt></td>
	  <td>Integer (image id)</td>
	  <td>Used to get an image id</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-DRAWABLE</tt></td>
	  <td>Integer (drawable id)</td>
	  <td>Get a drawable id</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-VALUE</tt></td>
	  <td>String</td>
	  <td>Input a numeric value</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-TOGGLE</tt></td>
	  <td>Boolean (TRUE or FALSE)</td>
	  <td>Input a booleon value</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-PATTERN</tt></td>
	  <td>String (Pattern name)</td>
	  <td>Lets you select a pattern</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-ADJUSTMENT</tt></td> <td>List
	  (start-value min-value max-value small-step large-step
	  [int=0 or float=1] [slider=0 or roll-box=1])</td>
	  <td>Creates a slider bar or a input box with range
	  values</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-FILENAME</tt></td>
	  <td>String (pathname)</td>
	  <td>Lets you browse for the file</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-STRING</tt></td>
	  <td>String</td>
	  <td>Creates a input box</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-FONT</tt></td>
	  <td>String (fontname)</td>
	  <td>Lets you select a font</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-COLOR</tt></td>
	  <td>List (red green blue) [0-255]</td>
	  <td>Lets you select a color</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-OPTION</tt></td>
	  <td>List of strings</td>
	  <td>Lets you select an item out of a list</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	  <td><tt class="code">SF-GRADIENT</tt></td>
	  <td>String (gradient name)</td>
	  <td>Lets you select a gradient</td>
	</tr>
    </table>

    <p>The following code creates a box with all possible input
    types:</p>

<pre class="code">(define (my-demo-box value adj1 adj2 image drawable toggle pattern string font color option gradient)
  (print "Do nothing"))

(script-fu-register "my-demo-box"
		    "&lt;Toolbox&gt;/Xtns/Script-Fu/My Stuff/Demo Box..."
		    "Do nothing"
		    "Joe User"
		    "Joe User"
		    "August 2000"
		    ""
		    SF-ADJUSTMENT "SF-ADJUSTMENT (slider)" '( 30 1 2000 1 10 1 0)
		    SF-ADJUSTMENT "SF-ADJUSTMENT"         '(400 1 2000 1 10 1 1)
		    SF-COLOR      "SF-COLOR" '(255 0 255)
		    SF-DRAWABLE   "SF-DRAWABLE" 0
		    SF-FONT       "SF-FONT" ""
		    SF-GRADIENT   "SF-GRADIENT"  "Golden"
		    SF-IMAGE      "SF-IMAGE" 0
		    SF-OPTION     "SF-OPTION" '("Option 1" "Option 2" "Option 3")
		    SF-PATTERN    "SF-PATTERN" "Wood"
		    SF-STRING     "SF-STRING" "Test String"
		    SF-TOGGLE     "SF-TOGGLE" TRUE
		    SF-VALUE      "SF-VALUE" "0"
                    SF-FILENAME   "SF-FILENAME" "/")</pre>

    <p>The resulting box will look like this:</p>

    <img src="images/demo-box.png">

    <p>So back to business, lets finish our Script-Fu example. We
      should start with the frame work, so we need to decide which
      argument types we need. As we want to create a font, we first
      need the text, so we use SF-STRING, than we should use SF-FONT
      for the font selection and in addition SF-VALUE to enter the
      font size.</p>

    <p>The creation of the <tt class="code">script-fu-register</tt> is
      left as an exercise for the user. If you don't want to try it
      yourself you can look some lines below for the finished
      script. The resulting box might then look like this:</p>

    <!-- Insert image -->

    <p>Now that we have our register call set up, we can fill the
      function with some code. First of we insert our two helper
      functions: <tt class="code">my-duplicate-layer</tt> and <tt
      class="code">my-layer-add-border</tt>, at the top of the
      file. Next, we more or less copy&amp;paste our Script-Fu Console
      experiments together. We move the <tt
      class="code">gimp-display-new</tt> call to the end of our
      function, so we don't have to see how the image rendering
      works. We also add another helper function, which will cut the
      final image to the right size. The resulting script might look
      then something like this:</p>

    <pre class="code">(define (my-image-to-layer-size image layer)
  (gimp-layer-set-offsets layer 0 0)
  (gimp-image-resize image
		     (car (gimp-drawable-width layer))
		     (car (gimp-drawable-height layer))
		     0 0))

(define (my-layer-add-border layer border)
	(let* ((width  (car (gimp-drawable-width  layer)))
	       (height (car (gimp-drawable-height layer))))
	       (gimp-layer-resize layer
				  (+ width border) (+ height border)
				  (/ border 2) (/ border 2))))

(define (my-duplicate-layer image layer)
	(let* ((dup-layer (car (gimp-layer-copy layer 1))))
              (gimp-image-add-layer image dup-layer 0)
	      dup-layer))

(define (my-make-metal-font text font font-size)
 (let* ((image (car (gimp-image-new 256 256 RGB)))
	(bottom-font-layer (car (gimp-text-fontname image -1 0 0 text 0 TRUE font-size PIXELS
					     font))))

   (let* ((top-font-layer (my-duplicate-layer image bottom-font-layer)))

     (my-layer-add-border bottom-font-layer 20)

     (gimp-layer-set-preserve-trans bottom-font-layer 0)
     (gimp-gradients-set-active "Four_bars")

     (gimp-selection-layer-alpha bottom-font-layer)
     (gimp-selection-grow image 3)
     (gimp-blend bottom-font-layer CUSTOM NORMAL LINEAR 100 0 REPEAT-NONE FALSE 0 0 0 0 200 50)


     (gimp-selection-layer-alpha top-font-layer)
     (gimp-blend top-font-layer    CUSTOM NORMAL LINEAR 100 0 REPEAT-NONE FALSE 0 0 0 50 200 0)
     (gimp-selection-clear image)

     (let* ((new-layer (car (gimp-image-merge-visible-layers
			     image EXPAND-AS-NECESSARY))))
       (my-image-to-layer-size image new-layer))

     (gimp-display-new image))
   ))

(script-fu-register "my-make-metal-font"
		    "&lt;Toolbox&gt;/Xtns/Script-Fu/Logos/Metal Font..."

    <h2><a name="pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</a></h2>
    <p>The following is a list of common pitfalls in Script-Fu.</p>

    <h3><a name="return">Return Values</a></h3>

    <p>When a function returns a value, it will always be encapsulated
      in a list; it doesn't matter whether only one value or multiple
      values. Even if the return value is itself a list, like for
      example the color returned by <tt
      class="code">gimp-color-picker</tt>, the return value will
      always be encapsulated in an extra list.</p>

    <p>If multiple values are returned they are also in a list, the
      first return value is the first element in the list, the second
      is the second list element, etc. So you need to always apply a
      <tt class="code">car</tt> call to get the correct value.</p>

      is the document which describes the scheme language, but
      sadly the language used in the Gimp is not R5SR compliance;
      not even close. Thats because Gimp uses SIOD as its scheme
      interpreter. SIOD is a small scheme implementation, the
      price is that it only provides a small subset of R5SR
      functions; even some of the functions' names have been changed. For example you
      don't have <tt class="code">display</tt>, only a function
      called <tt class="code">print</tt>. For a summary of scheme
      functions supported by the Gimp, you can have a look at the
      webpage of <a
		    href="http://people.delphi.com/gjc/siod.html">SIOD</a>. To
      make it even worse The Gimp doesn't even provide all the
      functions listed on the SIOD page, but its a good starting point.
      You can also use the function <tt class="code">apropos</tt> in
	  the console to search for a specific function:</p>

      <pre class="console-output">=> (apropos "write")

(fwrite writes swrite write-mask stroke-overwrite)</pre>

    <h2><a name="debug">Debugging</a></h2>

    <p>When you start to play with Script-Fu, and even when you are
      familiar with it, you will very often run into a situation where
      your script doesn't work. To make it even worse, sometimes you will not
      even get a error message. Most of the time, the cause will be
      simple, but the search hard. The following steps might make the
      search easier.</p>

    <p>First of check that your script is syntactically correct; that
      means you have closed all opened parentheses and quotes. An
      editor with syntax highlighting, automatic indention and
      parentheses highlighting will help to accomplish that.</p>

    <p>Second, you might have forgotten to add a <tt
      class="code">car</tt> to some return value. To check for these
      errors, copy&amp;paste your code into the Script-Fu Console and
      call it manually.</p>

    <pre class="console-output">ERROR: Invalid types specified for arguments</pre>

    <p>The above is most likely the error message you will get, if you
      get another error message, your bug might be elsewhere.</p>

    <p>When you call a function with too few or to much arguments, you
      will get the following error message:</p>

    <pre class="console-output">=&gt; (gimp-image-get-layers)
ERROR: too few arguments (see errobj)</pre>

    Than simply have a look at the errobj: it will tell you which
    arguments were expected and which you supplied.

    <pre class="console-output">=&gt; (print errobj)

((image))
()</pre>

    <p>At last if your function will still not work, add some <tt
    class="code">print</tt> calls at the right places to check that
    everything is working correctly. To see the output of the prints
    you have to run your Script-Fu in the console.</p>

    <h2><a name="cannotdo">Thing you can't do in Script-Fu</a></h2>

    <p>For now I have described what you can do with Script-Fu, but
      there are also a lot of things which you can't do in
      Script-Fu.</p>

    <p>The first thing, that you might want to do is to provide some
      better default values for the argument that your function will
      recieve. The bad news is that you can't do that, you can only
      pass constant values to the Script-Fu register call. So if your
      default value should, for example, be half the width of the image,
      you simply can't do that, you have to live with an constant
      value.</p>

    <p>Another thing you might want to have is some sort of GUI which
      goes behind the stuff that is provided by the SF-* values; and
      again: you can't do this. The SF-* values are all the gui that
      you can expect from Script-Fu. If you want more complicated
      stuff, like a preview window, you have to write a real Gimp
      Plug-in.</p>

    <p>At some point you might want to write your own filter or
      effect, which needs image manipulation at pixel level. That's a
      thing that you actually can do in Script-Fu. But it will be
      extremly slow, due to the interpreted nature of Script-Fu. So
      again, it's better to write that as a real Gimp Plug-in.</p>

    <p>You might also want to open a directory and open all the images
      in it. Not even that is possible. The SIOD webpage describes the
      <tt class="code">opendir</tt> function, but when you try it in
      Script-Fu it will not work as many other SIOD function.</p>

    <pre class="console-output">=&gt; (opendir "/")

ERROR: unbound variable (errobj opendir)</pre>

    <p>To solve this you have to work-around this by dumping the
      directory contents to a file and read that file instead, or you
      can write a Perl-Fu, Python-Fu or a Gimp Plug-in.</p>

    <p>There exists a project called <a
      href="http://anoncvs.jp.gnome.org/index.cgi/gimp-plugins-unstable/gimple/">gimple</a>
      in the Gnome CVS repositiory which might fix some of these
      issues. Gimple is a Guile interface for Gimp. It will have much
      better R5SR compliance than SIOD and will probably be able to
      call guile-gtk, to enable the creation of much more flexible
      gui-interfaces, but I don't know the status of this project and
      have never seen it in action.</p>

    <h2><a name="examples">Examples</a></h2>

    <p>It is always a good idea to have a look at foreign Script-Fu's
    to learn. Script-Fu's can for example be found in the Gimp
    directory <tt
    class="file">/usr/share/gimp/1.1/scripts/</tt>. There are also
    some links to other Script-Fu sites at the <a
    href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> webpage. I have also uploaded
    my Script-Fu's, you can find them <a href="scripts/">here</a>, but
    be warned, most of them are not documented, and some might not work
    at all.</p>
