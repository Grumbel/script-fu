    <h1>Script-fu Tutorial</h1>
    
    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
      The following tutorial is written for The Gimp 1.1.24. Some
      things described here will not work with The Gimp 1.0.x, some
      other probably will. I assume that the reader as a basic
      knowlege of Scheme.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This is a short tutorial to script-fu programming. I'll try to give a
      short intro into the word of script-fu and explain how basic things
      works.
    </p>

    <p>We will start by creating a script-fu step-by-step, the final
      script should produce a nice metal-looking text.</p>

    <p>Ok, now we take the first step, we try to do what we want to do
      script-fu first in The Gimp as normal. That is important, cause
      we need to know which steps we should take first and which
      second.</p>

    <p>First of we create a new rgb image "File->New Image" and insert
      some text into it, say the word "Test". Then we duplicate the
      text some times and apply a metal gradient to the top
      layer. Then we take the second text layer and enlarge it a bit,
      to do so, we use the alpha-to-selection function and grow the
      selection by a few pixels. Then we fill the selection with the
      same gradient, but in a another orientation. At last, we merge
      the layers and apply a standard drop shadow.</p>
    
    <p>Now be summarize, what we have done:</p>

    <ol>
	<li>Create a new image</li>
	<li>Enter some text</li>
	<li>Duplicate the text layer</li>
	<li>Enlarge the bottom layer</li>
	<li>Fill both text layers with a gradient</li>
	<li>Merge the text layers</li>
	<li>Apply a drop shadow</li>
	<li>Merge all layers</li>
	<li>Auto-crop the image</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The task is now to reproduce this nine steps in script-fu, to
      do so, we open the Script-fu console
      (Xtns->Script-fu->Console). The script-fu console is the place
      where you can enter script-fu commands and test them. Its the
      place where you should test all new functions you aren't handy
      with and its the place where you can more or less debug your
      written scripts.</p>

    <p>If the console is open, we click on the "Browse" button in the
      down left corner, this brings us to the DB Browser. Thats the
      place where you can search for functions you can access from
      script-fu. Along with the name of the function you also get a
      description of the arguments, its expect.</p>

    <p>So now its time to reproduce our first step in the image
      creation, so we need a function to create an new image. After a
      little search for "new" we find the function (gimp-image-new),
      which sounds like what we are searching for. We enter the
      following into the console:</p>

 (gimp-image-new 256 256 RGB)

and we will get an output as follows:

    <div class="console-output">
=> (gimp-image-new 256 256 RGB)

(3)
    </div>

    <p>The last line is the return value, as you can read in the DB
      Browser, this is the id of the newly created image and this is
      also the first pitfall on our guide to script-fu. The return
      value comes as a list and not as a single value! So to use the
      value, we have to get the first element of the list with car,
      car will then return the value 3.</p>

    <P>You might now wonder, where the image is that we have created,
      cause you cannot see it. The answer is, that we don't have a
      display for it, so the image is only inside the memory, but is
      not displayed, so we need create an display for it.  So we try
      <tt class="code">(gimp-display-new 3)</tt>, but we get an error:
    </p>

    <div class="console-output">
ERROR: Procedural database execution failed:
    (gimp_display_new 3)
    </div>

    <p>So, thats another pitfall. Our newly created image, doesn't contain
      any layers and to display an image, we actually need at least one
      layer. So we create an layer:</p>

(gimp-layer-new 3 256 256 RGB-IMAGE "foobar" 100 NORMAL-MODE)
<div class="console-output">
=> (gimp-layer-new 3 256 256 RGB_IMAGE "foobar" 100 NORMAL-MODE)

(21)
    </div>

    <p>You might notice, that the constant NORMAL-MODE is listed as
      NORMAL_MODE in the DB Browser (notice the underscore), so you have to
replace all the underscrores with minus's in the script-fu world.</p>

    <p>The next step is to add the layer to the image, as described in the DB
browser:</p>

(gimp-image-add-layer 3 21 0)
<div class="console-output">
=> (gimp-display-new 3)

(4)
    </div>
And now we can finally display our image:

<div class="console-output">
=> (gimp-display-new 3)

(4)
    </div>

The displayed image looks a bit wired, cause it filled with random
colors, to erase them, we will fill the layer with the current
background color.

    <div class="console-output">
=> (gimp-drawable-fill 21 BG-IMAGE-FILL)

()
    </div>
    
A drawable is (more or less) the same as a layer.

    <p>Now we have our image set up. To confusing? Then lets summarize
      and write our first scheme function. First we encapsule all into
      a let* clause and than add the let* clause into a function body:</p>

<div class="code">
(define (my-make-new-image)
 (let* ((image (car (gimp-image-new 256 256 RGB)))
        (layer (car (gimp-layer-new image 256 256 
                     RGB-IMAGE "foobar" 100 NORMAL-MODE))))
       (gimp-drawable-fill layer BG-IMAGE-FILL)
       (gimp-image-add-layer image layer 0)
       (gimp-display-new image)
       image))
    </div>

    <p>The last value is the return value, so image is the return
      value in this function.</p>

    <p>So back to our metal-text thing, we need now to add a text
      string and play with it. A little browsing in the DB brings up
      gimp-text-fontname.  To call it we type:</p>

(gimp-text-fontname 3 21 0 0 "Foobar" 0 TRUE 25 PIXELS
		    "-freefont-blippo-heavy-r-normal-*-24-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")

<div class="console-output">
=> (gimp-text-fontname 3 21 0 0 "Foobar" 0 TRUE 25 PIXELS
		    "-freefont-blippo-heavy-r-normal-*-24-*-*-*-p-*-iso8859-1")

(33)
    </div>

    <p>And voila, we have our text as a floating layer. The "fontname"
      might look as black-magic to you, but we will see later and easy
      way to create it.</p>

    <p>So lets convert the floating selection into a new layer with
      <tt class="code">gimp-floating-sel-to-layer</tt> and start to make it metal like.</p>

<div class="console-output">
=> (gimp-floating-sel-to-layer 33)

()
    </div>

<p>Now we need to duplicate that layer, you might notice that there is
now duplicate layer in the DB, so we need to do it manually:</p>

<div class="code">
(define (my-duplicate-layer image layer)
	(let* ((dup-layer (car (gimp-layer-copy layer 1))))
              (gimp-image-add-layer image dup-layer 0)
	      dup-layer))
    </div>
and than:
<div class="console-output">
=> (my-duplicate-layer 3 34)

41
    </div>
    
    <p>Than we need to add some space for the enlarged text border,
      gimp-layer-resize is our friend:</p>
<div class="console-output">
    (gimp-layer-resize 41 200 100 5 5)
    </div>

This works, but the width and height are hard coded, so we try again
in a more flexible manner:

    <div class="code">
(define (my-layer-add-border layer border)
	(let* ((width  (car (gimp-drawable-width  layer)))
	       (height (car (gimp-drawable-height layer))))
	       (gimp-layer-resize layer
				  (+ width border) (+ height border)
				  (/ border 2) (/ border 2))))
    </div>

Now we need to transfer the layers alpha cannel to the selection and
grow it some pixels:

(gimp-selection-layer-alpha 41)
(gimp-selection-grow 3 5)

Before we fill the layer, we have to remove the "Keep trans" flag,
which causes that all transparent areas stay transparent:

(gimp-layer-set-preserve-trans 41 0) 

Now we will fill the selection with a gradient:

(gimp-blend 41 CUSTOM NORMAL LINEAR 100 0 REPEAT-NONE FALSE 0 0 0 0 30 50)


Script-fu
~~~~~~~~~~

Huh, now we have everything for our script-fu ready, we just need to
attach the pieces. In the following steps we will also remove some
unnecessary action and probably add some stuff.

Ok, so how to write a script-fu? Simply have a look at
~/.gimp-1.1/scripts/, thats the place where all script-fu's will
end. So open your favorite text editor and create a file
my-metal-logo.scm and save it into the directory ~/.gimp-1.1/scripts/
When you then press "Xtns->Scritp-fu->Reload" your script will be
loaded into "The Gimp", but before you will see anything, we first
need to register our function.

The function script-fu-register is the function, which is capable of
doing that. The first argument is the function name of your newly
written function, the second is the place, where your function will be
appear inside the Gimp. The other arguments are for the Copyright,
author, etc. The eight and the following arguments become interessting
again, this are the arguments, which your function will recive. An
example script-fu-register call would look like this:

    <div class="code">
(script-fu-register "script-fu-gradient-example"
		    _"&lt;Toolbox&gt;/Xtns/Script-Fu/Utils/Custom Gradient..."
		    "Create an example image of a custom gradient"
		    "Federico Mena Quintero"
		    "Federico Mena Quintero"
		    "June 1997"
		    ""
		    SF-ADJUSTMENT _"Width" '(400 1 2000 1 10 0 1)
		    SF-ADJUSTMENT _"Height" '(30 1 2000 1 10 0 1))
    </div>
